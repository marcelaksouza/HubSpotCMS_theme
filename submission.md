# Submission Notes
Hello guys this was a very nice project and I am happy to be part of the selection process. 

# Given more time, what would you have done differently?
Even though I am submitting this now I am definitely gonna make a few things better in the following days. I learned everything from scratch and would love to try some other things. Such as other options in the fields file, responsivity, and a deep dive in modules. 

# How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?
The last part is to create a module a have a few things to share. 
I was able to fetch the data and display it on the console log although I was not able to add them to the team member cards. That is something I will definitely dedicate some extra time to try to figure it out. Therefore this module is not working as asked in the exercise. What I did instead repeated the image and text modules. Other than that I believe I got the other specifications working.

# Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
I had a lot of fun doing this project and I learned a lot, thank you for this opportunity.
